const content = `# Accordion
Interactive panels for toggling visibility of content

Accordion elements help organize information by letting users show or hide sections as needed. Theyâ€™re an effective way to manage progressive disclosure and simplify navigation through dense or optional content.

## Accordion Usage
You can use the Accordion component directly within your MDX files without any import. The following example shows a basic usage:

~~~mdx
<Accordion title="What is MDX?">
    You can put any content in here, including other components, like code:

   \`\`\`java HelloWorld.java
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
  \`\`\`
</Accordion>
~~~

<Accordion title="What is MDX?">
    You can put any content in here, including other components, like code:

   \`\`\`java HelloWorld.java
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

        }
    }
